# Open Agreements

[![Matrix]][matrix-community]

As Elypia is a [registered company](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/12203025),
we need contracts or agreements documented on occasion to avoid legal
challenges. Where possible, we like to use openly available licenses or
agreements that already exist but, sometimes we make them ourselves if we don't
see open alternatives available that fit our requirements.

We're hoping as a community we'll be able to create very simple and
flexibly written contracts, that anyone will have the freedom to use,
modify, and redistribute however they want.  

# Disclaimer

Elypia is not a law firm, we do not specialize in legal documents or writing
binding contracts between parties. These documents should be thoroughly checked
before use, and preferably modified to suit your requirements.

# Documents

All documents are shared in Markdown and text form, it's recommended to present
them in a format that is most appropriate for your requirements.

You'll likely find that you'll need to alter or exclude clauses in to fit your
requirements. This repository tries its best to separate clauses into sections
and sub-sections, so it's easy to pick out and remove to respective statement
that may be adverse to your needs.

## Open Copyright Transfer Agreement (OCTA)

The [copyright transfer agreement] as written in the repository, allows
rightsholders of copyrighted material to transfer that copyright to another
entity (organization or person). 

Note that in some countries, transfer of copyright is not a concept that exists.

## Open Exclusive Copyright License Agreement (OECLA)

The exclusive copyright license agreement as written in the repository,
grants all rights from a rightsholder of copyrighted material to
another entity, except the right to commercially sub-license the work.

This means you can use, modify, and redistribute the work commercially,
however may not sub-license the work to others or to the public 
for profit. (You can omit this clause if it doesn't suit you.)
